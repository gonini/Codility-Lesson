PermMissingElem
-------------

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

int solution(vector<int> &A);

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2 </p>
  A[1] = 3 </p>
  A[2] = 1 </p>
  A[3] = 5 </p>
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000]; </p>
the elements of A are all distinct; </p>
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)]. </p>
Complexity: 

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); </p>
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). </p>
Elements of input arrays can be modified. </p>
